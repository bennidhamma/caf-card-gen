Theater for Climate Justice,"## How do we use theater and spectacle for climate justice?

Theater brings climate justice issues to life. Through plays, skits, or storytelling events, people can understand the impact of climate change and how it affects different communities. This helps people feel connected to the stories and more motivated to take action.

## How to practice
* **Research:** Attend a play or storytelling event, or look for some online, that are focused on the environment. What works? What doesn't?
* **Develop:** Write a short play or skit about a climate justice issue or a related moral.
* **Present:** Stage your skit at school events, local gatherings, in front of a business, or on a street corner!",#e6e6e6
